This function import wait_random from the previous python file that
Iâ€™ve written and write an async routine called wait_n that takes 
n 2 int arguments (in this order): n and max_delay. You will spawn
wait_random n times with the specified max_delay.

wait_n should return the list of all the delays (float values).
The list of the delays should be in ascending order without using
sort() because of concurrency.
